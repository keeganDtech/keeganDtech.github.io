                <h2>What is a Devil?</h2>

                <p>Devil's in the Chainsaw Man universe are physical manifestations of fear. These collective fears 
                    gather to form a Devil named after it. To put a simpler explanation to it, just think about something 
                    people fear such as spiders, bats, or blood. Each of these concepts have a Devil named after them 
                    and there strength grows based on how fearful that Devil or concept is.
