                <p>The Chainsaw Man anime began airing October 12 2022, and finished it's first season December 27 2022.
                    Animated by Studio MAPPA, Directed by Ryu Nakayama and Masato Nakazono. Since the first episode came out
                    fans of the series have praised the adaptation of this manga, MAPPA clearly worked hard to expertly craft
                    beautiful 2d animation as well as savage intense and weighty CGI animation.
                </p>
                
                <p>The Voice Actors are especially a favorite of mine. Every very single character feels like they have the perfect
                    voice to match their personality and demeanor from the manga. While the cast is a mixup of new and experienced VA's
                    they all bring life to their characters equally.
